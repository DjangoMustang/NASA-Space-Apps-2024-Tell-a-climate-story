# **Comic-Style Climate Change Storytelling with Power BI Visualizations**

## **Project Overview**
This project presents an innovative approach to educating and inspiring action on climate change through a combination of **comic-style storytelling** and **interactive data visualizations**. The narrative is based on factual events and data, supported by Power BI dashboards, offering users a compelling and interactive experience. The story focuses on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, their effects, and potential solutions, with an emphasis on personal responsibility via a **GHG Footprint Calculator**.

## **Key Features**
- **Comic-Style Storytelling**: Engaging visual narrative covering the causes, effects, and solutions related to GHG emissions.
- **Interactive Power BI Visualizations**: Dynamic data insights explaining the sources of GHG emissions, current impacts, and future forecasts.
- **GHG Footprint Calculator**: A user-friendly tool that allows individuals to calculate their personal GHG emissions and get actionable recommendations for reducing them. (in process)
  
## **Story Phases**
1. **Current GHG Problems**: Highlighting ongoing climate disasters like floods, wildfires, and droughts.
2. **Sources of GHG Emissions**: Visual data on the major contributors.
3. **Effects on All Life Forms**: Demonstrating the widespread impact on ecosystems and human health.
4. **Forecasting the Future**: Predicting future GHG trends and their effects.
5. **Solutions**: Outlining realistic steps to reduce GHG emissions.
6. **Aftermath after implementing solution**: Visualizing a better future..
